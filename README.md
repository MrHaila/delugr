## Backlog

- Song details (rename, delete, song length?, used instruments, broken instruments?, something else?)
- Re-open same folder as last time to speed up HMR development
- Reusable list card? (stripes, hover, linking, ..., sorting, searching)
- Netlify deploy
- Pass on colors

## Technical Stuff
